You are to write a short C program.   The program will input a user’s first name followed by a number that represents the number of times to display the name.
The output will be a line number followed by the NAME.  This will be displayed X times.
You are to include your C Source and your Design Tool.
Once completed you are to attach your *.C version of the code to Blackboard.  DO NOT ATTACH a *.SLN document to Blackboard.  Do NOT ATTACH a project folder or *.SLN document to Blackboard ever.  Only attach *.c or *.h files.

This is how you will input a word.  A word is a group of characters.  In programming, a group of characters is called a STRING.  In the C programming language there is no actual data type for a STRING.  In order to represent a string do the following:
1.	Declare the string
a.	char firstName[50];  // the string is firstName.  It will hold a group of characters.  The actual number of characters is actually 49.  The 50th position holds the end of string marker.  C will populate the end of string for you.
2.	To input a string
a.	scanf(“%s”, firstName);  // do not use the & when scanning a STRING.
3.	To output a string
a.	printf(“Hello the string was %s.\n”, firstName);
