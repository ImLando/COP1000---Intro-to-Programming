The random number guessing game program.
You are to write a C program that will generate a random number between 1 and 100. You are to allow a user of the program to try to guess the random number up to 10 times. If the user guesses the number you need to display a message. You are to display a message if the user guesses too high or too low. You are also to display a message once the user runs out of attempts to guess the number. You should inform the user how many guesses he or she has remaining.
i.e. you guessed it, the number was 55. You guessed it in exactly 7 guesses.
i.e. your guess was too high, you have 8 guesses remaining…guess LOWER
i.e. you guess was too low, you have 2 guesses remaining…guess HIGHER
i.e. you ran out of guesses, the number was 88
Once the game ends, you need to ask the user if he or she wishes to play again...you need to continue to let the user play the game until he or she wishes to quit.
As with all programs, you need to insert comments, and write neat indented code. Once you are finished you are to attach the *.c program to the assignment thread.
NOTES/COMMENTS/HINTS
To seed a random number you will need the following once in your code:
srand((unsigned)time(NULL));//seed rand function
To use time() you will need to include time.h
To generate a random number between LOWERBOUND and UPPERBOUND you will need the following code:
theNumber = LOWERBOUND + rand() % (UPPERBOUND - LOWERBOUND + 1);
